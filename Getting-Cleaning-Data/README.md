Coursera-Project-Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This is the Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data Project

Here's the main idea on how to do this project: 1: Download the data set, and read the README file carefully, to get an understanding of how this dataset is about 2: Read the features and activity_labels into R, since the data contained is factor, we should transfer it into character 3: Extract "mean" or "std" from the activity_labels 4: Read the test set data, bind it with features and labels, and then do the same to the training set data, next, combine training set and test set 5: (Optinal)Remove redundant dataframe, to make it looks concise 6: Melt the combined data, and calculate the mean by its feature and label 7: Use real character to replace the labels which originally was numbers 8: Write the dataset
